Chattanooga?s Clay Bennett is ?thrilled? to win 2014 Berryman Award for editorial cartooning ?Subtle and wry? humor? Right-o. ?Flawless? execution? Yep  a critical trifecta. National Press Foundation jurors ascribed all those attributes to the editorial work of Clay Bennett  who has won the organization?s 2014 Clifford K. & James T. Berryman Award for Editorial Cartoons. ?The Berryman Award is such a terrific honor ? Bennett  of the Chattanooga Times Free Press  tells The Post?s Comic Riffs over the weekend. ?I?m just thrilled that the National Press Foundation considers my work to be worthy of their recognition.? The foundation  in fact  is just the latest body to deem Bennett?s work worthy. His ribbon-strewn year also includes winning the Grambs Aronson Award for cartooning  as well as being a finalist for the Herblock Prize and the National Cartoonists Society?s Editorial Cartooning award. Bennett  the 2002 Pulitzer winner for Editorial Cartooning and a seven-time Prize finalist  wants to ensure that some of that limelight shines on his editors  too. ?A share of this should go to the great bosses I have here at the Chattanooga Times Free Press ? Bennett tells Comic Riffs. ?The freedom they give me is unbelievable  and their support of my work has always been unwavering. ?An editorial cartoonist couldn?t ask for better gig.? Bennett will be presented with the Berryman Award -- named for the ol? Washington Star father-and-son political-cartooning team -- on Feb. 18 at the foundation?s gala/dinner ceremony in Washington.##http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2014/12/15/chattanoogas-clay-bennett-wins-2014-berryman-award-for-editorial-cartooning/##2014-12-16 09:47:01.0##2014-12-16 09:47:01.0
